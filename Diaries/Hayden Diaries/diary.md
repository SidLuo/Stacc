# Week 7
In the previous week, we had mostly completed our planning and initial set up. All of our group members had finished setting up the development environment and we had planned out a good number of tasks on pivotal tracker, so we were ready to get to work.

During the sprint, we completed a reasonable proportion of tasks that corresponded to the basic functionality of the system. These included having a working simple user interface, account creation, menu editing and an ordering system. We were quite near the minimum viable product point, slightly ahead of schedule. This was to preemptively make up for work that may not get done during an expected busy period leading up to and including the mid-semester break.

At this stage, our project is running quite smoothly and there are no real road blocks. We are making significant progress, so the outlook is good. Since it was Je that initially set up the project, it took a bit of time to wrap my head around how to manage the framework and how all of the project files were related, but I was able to make sense of it after a while and could begin contributing.

# Week 8
The end of this week corresponded to our first intended release, the minimum viable product. As the majority of the functionality had been completed the previous week, we used this sprint to focus our efforts on the project plan document and presentation during the meeting.

As the product owner, I took the initiative to set up the initial templates for the presentation slides and the document. I decided what sort of content we wanted to have in each of them and designed the templates as such, then collaborated with the scrum master Gautham to assign sections to our group members. We all completed our sections promptly and I then compiled our work into the respective HTML slides and LaTeX documents, tidying it up for presentation.

Due to the nature of the tasks I was working on this sprint, I was unable to contribute much to the development, which was mostly handled by other group members. Although this hasn't affected our progress, we should be able to complete more with all members participating. As we have completed the necessary documentation this week, I intend to spend the coming weeks further improving the software project.

# Week 9
In accordance with my plan from the previous sprint, I used my time this week to contribute to the software project. I spent the majority of the time working on the main css files that corresponded to each section of our web application. As there are many similar portions of the system, I was able to share style sheets across multiple pages. I made numerous modifications to various visual aspects but some features that stood out in particular included a persistent and dynamic navigation bar on each page and a general overhaul of the front-end design. I also collected some creative-commons licensed background patterns to use in future iterations.

On the back end, our team also completed a few more user stories. These included features such as allowing physical location lookup of nearby businesses and creating orders without an account. Most notably, we also implemented a payment system using PayPal's sandbox API, which allowed us to confirm we have working payments for our orders. As we plan to have a release at the end of the next sprint with some additional features on top of our minimum viable product, I think we're working at a very good pace. 

I also noticed a bit of an issue this week as I was working on the project. As I'm primarily working on the front-end of the application, I realised that there weren't that many user stories that corresponded to these tasks. We didn't add user stories in this category because it didn't seem quite appropriate, but this made it a bit more difficult to manage this end of development. I think the best way to go about remedying this situation is to add a large number of tasks to the user story about users wanting to have a visually appealing and responsive interface.

# Midsem Break
Carrying on from the previous week, I spent some more time this sprint to continue work on the front end of the application. I made a fair number of significant changes to the styling of the website throughout the sprint. I also collected some Creative Commons-licensed background patterns from SubtlePatterns to use in our product. On top of this, I designed a logo which I added to the homepage. I think this added a nice touch and gave a sense of ownership of the product. I don't think this will be our final design, but it looks a lot more presentable than it did before.

On the back end, our group also made some minor changes. These were just small features such as letting businesses accept orders and displaying this to users, allowing users to add comments to orders, and dividing business menus into categories for nicer display. There was also some slight bug fixing, but overall, there were no major features pushed this week.

During this sprint, we didn't quite make as much progress as we did in previous sprints. This was primarily due to being busy with other tasks. As the company case study was due at the end of the sprint, all team members were simultaneously out of commission for a number of days, which slowed down our development substantially. Thankfully we accounted for this in our sprint plans and did not fall behind, so we are in good shape to resume work next week.

# Week 10
Having freed up some time this week, our team was able to spend a bit more time working on the project. Since the front page was acceptable in terms of appearance, I focused on the user and business control panels this week. They were still quite simple in terms of features so there wasn't much to do, but I spent some time trialing different layouts and backgrounds to find one that I was reasonably happy with. It became cleaner overall and matched the front page properly, making our site start to look a lot more proper.

Some of the other team members worked on developing more features as well. Our product now allows business to provide a time estimate on how long an order will take to complete, as well as update it in real-time. This feature is still quite basic though, as ajax has yet to be implemented to make it display nicely. There is now also a feature to provide a one-time order code so that users won't need to bring a device to confirm their order.

Despite the progress this week, our burnup chart still looked quite flat and dull. The issue I mentioned back in week 9 had made itself quite apparent this sprint. Despite all of the work on the UI, there was only one user story corresponding to this, which skewed the perception of how much work was completed. That being said, it's not a major issue and I don't think it would be worthwhile to modify our user stories to account for this at this point in the project.

# Week 11
Unfortunately I wasn't able to contribute much this week. When I found the time I would make small adjustments and tweaks here and there, which accumulated a number of small improvements. However unlike in previous sprints, I didn't make any major developments or overhauls. Granted you can only "overhaul" a certain number of times within reason and I was preoccupied with other tasks, though this isn't much of an excuse. Thankfully my team was able to cover for me this week and continued work on the back end.

The new features for this week were not as plentiful as before, but this is mainly due to the fact that the product is more or less complete, and anything beyond this point is an extension or stretch goal. That's not to say there was no progress, though. Business now have access to a central dashboard to view and control orders, and are also able to enable discount codes that users can apply to their purchases. As a quality of life design choice, business menu items are now also divided into sections.

Since the product is in its final phases, the workflow is slowing down. However there is still plenty that can be improved, especially with the front end, which is my primary focus. In the next sprint, I fully intend to compensate for the work that I didn't do this time around so that our final product is one we can all be proud to put on display.

# Week 12
To make up for my display last week, I wanted to spend this sprint working hard to make sure we have the best possible product to present in the upcoming meeting. As the product is mostly complete functionality-wise, we wanted to make it as visually appealing as possible to make it impressive when the time came to demonstrate it. As such, this is where I devoted the majority of my efforts this sprint.

Another team member Sid implemented Materialize, a free CSS framework developed by Google. Applying it to our application made it look immensely better, but there were a number of kinks and inconsistencies. Thanks to this though, there was a lot to do. I primarily worked through fixing bugs that had arisen and customizing the styling to make it fit our application better. I also went back and refactored a large percentage of the code, as the continual development had made it rather messy and less presentable.

I was able to get quite a lot of work done this week, even if most of it was quite laborious and not so creative. I think the finishing touches that all the team members contributed towards resulted in a very respectable final product, so all that's left to do is present it and hope for the best.
